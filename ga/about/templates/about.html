				rimes and Associates began conducting business in Lubbock in 1982 while serving the engineering needs of architects throughout Texas and Eastern New Mexico.
				<br /><br />
				Approximately three years later in 1985 we expanded our operation to allow us to work directly with large institutional clients like the City of Lubbock, Lubbock ISD, Veterans Administration, General Services Administration, etc. as well as with our architectural clients.
				<br />
				Two years later, in 1987, we expanded once again to serve the environmental needs of our architectural and institutional clients, working mostly in the asbestos-related fields.
				<br />
				1989 witnessed even further expansion of our environmental services as we now address underground fuel storage systems and lead-in-water studies.
				<br /><br />
				Our business continues to expand as necessary to serve the needs of our customers. We are now involved in energy-conservation design, investigation of lead-based-paint, real estate inspections and facility renovations. During the time RTC was in existence, Grimes & Associates was an approved contractor for Phase 1, 2, &3 ESAs.
				<br /><br />
				In 2001, we added the disciplines of project and construction management to our repertoire with the addition to our staff of two experienced managers. These individuals bring over 60 years of professional management experience to our staff. Our CM department continues to grow as additional superintendents are added to our staff.
				<br /><br />
				With the addition of these top professionals, Grimes and Associates now provide program management services to our valued customers. We have the expertise to manage a project from the beginning conceptual design, provide master plans and demographics studies, through the bond program, planning and design phases, right on through the construction delivery and construction administration phase of the project. The same person that you start the project with is the same person you finish the project with.
				<br /><br />
				In summary, our experience demonstrates the desire to provide all the professional services necessary to ensure that our customers receive the maximum benefit from each of their facilities.
